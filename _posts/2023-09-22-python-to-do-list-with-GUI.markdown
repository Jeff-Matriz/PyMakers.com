Welcome back to PyMakers, your creative coding sanctuary. In this project, we're diving into the world of graphical user interfaces (GUI) and task management by creating a "To-Do List with GUI." This project is designed to help you stay organized while adding a touch of style and interactivity to your everyday tasks.

<h4>Why a To-Do List with GUI?</h4>

To-do lists are essential for keeping track of tasks, and adding a graphical user interface (GUI) to your to-do list takes it to a new level. By creating a To-Do List with GUI in Python, you'll not only learn about GUI development but also have a visually appealing and interactive tool for managing your tasks. It's a project that combines functionality with aesthetics.

<h4>The Python Code</h4>

Let's dive straight into the Python code for our To-Do List with GUI:

{% highlight ruby %}
import tkinter as tk

def add_task():
    task = entry.get()
    if task:
        listbox.insert(tk.END, task)
        entry.delete(0, tk.END)

def remove_task():
    try:
        selected_task = listbox.curselection()[0]
        listbox.delete(selected_task)
    except IndexError:
        pass

app = tk.Tk()
app.title("To-Do List with GUI")

frame = tk.Frame(app)
frame.pack(pady=10)

listbox = tk.Listbox(frame, selectbackground="yellow")
listbox.pack()

entry = tk.Entry(frame, font=("Helvetica", 12))
entry.pack(pady=5)

add_button = tk.Button(frame, text="Add Task", command=add_task)
add_button.pack(pady=5)

remove_button = tk.Button(frame, text="Remove Task", command=remove_task)
remove_button.pack()

app.mainloop()
{% endhighlight%}

<h4>How it Works</h4>
<ol>
	<li>We import the <code>tkinter</code> library for creating the GUI.</li>
	<li>We define functions <code>add_task()</code> and <code>remove_task()</code> to add and remove tasks from the to-do list.</li>
	<li>We create the main application window and add a title.</li>
	<li>Within the window, we create a frame to hold the GUI components.</li>
	<li>We use a <code>Listbox</code> to display the list of tasks, an <code>Entry</code> widget for entering new tasks, and buttons for adding and removing tasks.</li>
	<li>The <code>add_task()</code> function adds the task entered in the <code>Entry</code> widget to the <code>Listbox</code>.</li>
	<li>The <code>remove_task()</code> function removes the selected task from the <code>Listbox</code>.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

Congratulations! You've just created a Python To-Do List with a graphical user interface (GUI). This project has introduced you to GUI development using `tkinter`, and it provides a practical and visually appealing solution for task management.

Whether you're keeping track of your daily tasks or experimenting with GUI development, this To-Do List with GUI adds style and functionality to your programming repertoire. Stay tuned for more Python projects that blend creativity with utility. Happy coding! üêç‚ú®
