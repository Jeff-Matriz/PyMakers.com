<h2>Getting Started with Python</h2>

If you're new to Python, fear not; we'll guide you through the basics. Python is a versatile and beginner-friendly programming language. To get started, you'll need to install Python on your computer.

<h4>Installing Python</h4>

Here's a quick guide on installing Python:
<ol>
  <li><strong>Windows:</strong> Head to the Python website and download the Windows installer. Run the installer, and make sure to check the box that says, "Add Python to PATH" during installation.</li>
  <li><strong>macOS:</strong> For Mac users, visit the Python website and download the macOS installer. Run the installer, and you're good to go.</li>
  <li><strong>Linux:</strong> Most Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed. Open your terminal and type python3 to check if it's already available. If not, you can install it using your package manager.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Running Your First Python Program</h4>

Now that Python is installed let's kick things off with a simple "Hello, World!" program. It's the traditional first program for every programmer, and it's a great way to get comfortable with Python.
<ol>
  <li>Open a text editor like Notepad (Windows), TextEdit (macOS), or any code editor you prefer.</li>
  <li>Type the following Python code: <code>print("Hello, World!")</code></li>
  <li>Save the file with a .py extension. For example, you can name it hello.py.</li>
  <li>Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and type: <code>python hello.py</code></li>
</ol>

You should see "Hello, World!" displayed in your terminal. Congratulations, you've just run your first Python program!
