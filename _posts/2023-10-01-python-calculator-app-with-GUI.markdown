Welcome back to PyMakers, your creative coding playground. In this project, we're diving into the world of graphical user interfaces (GUI) and mathematics by building a "Calculator with GUI" using Python. This interactive tool is designed to help you perform calculations with flair and ease.

<h4>Why a Calculator with GUI?</h4>

Calculators are essential for everyday math tasks, and adding a graphical user interface (GUI) makes them even more user-friendly. By creating a Calculator with GUI in Python, you'll not only learn about GUI development but also have a stylish and functional tool for performing calculations. It's a project that combines math and aesthetics.

<h4>The Python Code</h4>

Let's dive right into the Python code for our Calculator with GUI:
{% highlight python %}
import tkinter as tk

# Function to handle button clicks
def button_click(event):
    current = entry.get()
    text = event.widget.cget("text")

    if text == "=":
        try:
            result = str(eval(current))
            entry.delete(0, tk.END)
            entry.insert(tk.END, result)
        except Exception as e:
            entry.delete(0, tk.END)
            entry.insert(tk.END, "Error")
    elif text == "C":
        entry.delete(0, tk.END)
    else:
        entry.insert(tk.END, text)

app = tk.Tk()
app.title("Calculator with GUI")

entry = tk.Entry(app, font=("Helvetica", 16))
entry.pack(fill=tk.BOTH, expand=True)

button_frame = tk.Frame(app)
button_frame.pack()

buttons = [
    "7", "8", "9", "/",
    "4", "5", "6", "*",
    "1", "2", "3", "-",
    "C", "0", "=", "+"
]

row, col = 1, 0
for button in buttons:
    btn = tk.Button(button_frame, text=button, font=("Helvetica", 12))
    btn.grid(row=row, column=col, padx=10, pady=10)
    btn.bind("<Button-1>", button_click)
    col += 1
    if col > 3:
        col = 0
        row += 1

app.mainloop()

{% endhighlight %}

<h4>How it Works</h4>
<ol>
	<li>We import the <code>tkinter</code> library to create the GUI for the calculator.</li>
	<li>We define a function, <code>button_click()</code>, that handles button clicks and performs the calculations.</li>
	<li>Inside the main application, we create an entry field to display the current input and result.</li>
	<li>We create buttons for digits, arithmetic operations, and special buttons like "C" (clear) and "=" (calculate).</li>
	<li>Buttons are arranged in a grid within the <code>button_frame</code>.</li>
	<li>Button clicks are bound to the <code>button_click()</code> function, which updates the display based on user input.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

Congratulations! You've just created a Python Calculator with a graphical user interface (GUI). This project introduces you to GUI development and provides a stylish and interactive solution for performing calculations.

Whether you're crunching numbers for school, work, or personal projects, this Calculator with GUI adds a touch of style and ease to your mathematical tasks. Stay tuned for more Python projects that bring creativity and functionality to your coding journey. Happy coding! üêç‚ú®
