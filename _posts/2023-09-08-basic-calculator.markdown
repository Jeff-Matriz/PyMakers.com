Welcome to the world of Python programming, where we transform complex tasks into fun and engaging projects. Today, we're diving into one of the classics: building a basic calculator. It's the perfect beginner project to not only practice Python but also create a practical tool that can perform simple arithmetic operations.

<h4>Why a Basic Calculator?</h4>

A calculator is a useful tool that everyone can appreciate. By building one in Python, you'll get to know how to take user input, perform mathematical operations, and present the results. It's a fantastic way to get started with Python, especially if you're new to coding.

<h4>The Python Code</h4>

We'll start by creating a calculator that can add, subtract, multiply, and divide. Here's the code:

{% highlight ruby %}
# Function to add two numbers
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

# Function to subtract two numbers
def subtract(x, y):
    return x - y

# Function to multiply two numbers
def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y

# Function to divide two numbers
def divide(x, y):
    if y == 0:
        return "Cannot divide by zero"
    return x / y

# Main program loop
while True:
    print("Options:")
    print("Enter 'add' for addition")
    print("Enter 'subtract' for subtraction")
    print("Enter 'multiply' for multiplication")
    print("Enter 'divide' for division")
    print("Enter 'exit' to end the program")

    user_input = input(": ")

    if user_input == "exit":
        print("Goodbye!")
        break
    elif user_input in ("add", "subtract", "multiply", "divide"):
        num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
        num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))
        
        if user_input == "add":
            print("Result: ", add(num1, num2))
        elif user_input == "subtract":
            print("Result: ", subtract(num1, num2))
        elif user_input == "multiply":
            print("Result: ", multiply(num1, num2))
        elif user_input == "divide":
            print("Result: ", divide(num1, num2))
    else:
        print("Invalid input")

{% endhighlight %}

<h4>How it Works</h4>
<ol>
	<li>We define four functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, each taking two numbers as input and returning the result.</li>
	<li>Inside the main program loop, we present a menu with options for the user to choose from: 'add', 'subtract', 'multiply', 'divide', and 'exit'.</li>
	<li>Based on the user's choice, we ask for two numbers and use the corresponding function to perform the operation. The result is displayed.</li>
	<li>If the user chooses 'exit', the program ends. If the input is not recognized, the program displays "Invalid input."</li>
</ol>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

You've just created your very own Python Basic Calculator! This project introduced you to functions, user input, conditional statements, and basic arithmetic operations. It's a simple but essential step in your Python journey, so keep experimenting and exploring.
