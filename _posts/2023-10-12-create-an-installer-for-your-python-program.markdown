So, you've successfully developed your Python application and even created a standalone executable using PyInstaller. Now, it's time to take the next step: making it easy for users to install and use your application. In this blog, we'll explore how to create an installer for your Python program using the Inno Setup Compiler. These step-by-step instructions will guide you through the process, ensuring a smooth and user-friendly installation experience.

**What is Inno Setup Compiler?**

[Inno Setup Compiler][inno] is a powerful and free script-driven installation system created in Delphi. It simplifies the process of creating program installers for Windows. With Inno Setup, you can package your Python applications and all their associated files into a single installer, making it convenient for users to install your software.

**Step-by-Step Guide**

Here's a detailed guide on how to create an installer for your Python program using Inno Setup Compiler:

**1. Create a New Script File Using Script Wizard**

To get started, open Inno Setup Compiler and create a new script file using the Script Wizard. The wizard provides a user-friendly interface to guide you through the process.

**2. Fill in Application Details**

In the wizard, you'll be prompted to fill in essential details about your application, such as the application name, version, publisher, and website (if applicable).

**3. Define the Application Destination Folder**

Choose the destination folder where your application will be installed. By default, you can set it to "Program Files." Additionally, you can enable the option that allows users to change the installation folder if desired.

**4. Specify the Location of the Executable File**

Define the location of your Python executable file. This typically involves adding folders from your distribution (`dist`) directory containing program assets.

**5. Configure Application File Association (Optional)**

If your application is associated with specific file types, you can configure file associations in this step. However, in many cases, this may not be necessary.

**6. Create Start Menu and Desktop Shortcuts**

Enable the option to create shortcuts for your application in the Start Menu and on the desktop. This makes it convenient for users to access your program.

**7. Include a License Agreement**

It's good practice to include a [license agreement][license] that users must accept before installing your application. You can create a text file containing your license agreement and reference it in the script.

**8. Choose Installation Mode**

Select the installation mode, such as "Admin install mode" for all users, ensuring your application is available to all users of the computer.

**9. Set Language Options**

Choose the language for the installer, making it accessible to a diverse range of users.

**10. Define the Custom Compiler Output Directory**

Specify where the installer file will be located. You can set the installer output name and provide an installer icon.

**11. Utilize Compiler Directives**

Leave the option to use `#define` compiler directives checked.

**12. Handle Subfolders (if applicable)**

If your program has subfolders containing assets, you may need to make some adjustments. In the FILES section, you can specify the destination directory for these assets. For each subfolder, ensure that the `DestDir` matches the structure of your program's assets.

**13. Save the Installer Script**

It's a good practice to save your installer script (use `CTRL + S`) to keep a backup for future reference.

**14. Compile and Locate the Installer**

Finally, click "Finish" and then "Compile" (use `CTRL + F9`). This will generate the installer. You can locate the installer file in the directory you specified earlier.

Creating an installer with Inno Setup Compiler streamlines the distribution of your Python application, ensuring that users can install and use your software with ease. Whether you're sharing your project with colleagues, clients, or the world, Inno Setup Compiler is a valuable tool in your developer toolkit.

With these simple steps, you can make your Python program accessible to a broader audience, simplifying the installation process and enhancing the user experience. Happy coding, and may your applications reach new heights of popularity! üöÄüêç
